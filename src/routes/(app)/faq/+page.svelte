<h1> These are questions I'm frequently asked. </h1>

<Section
    id="recommendations"
    header="Will you write me a letter of recommendation?"
>
    <p>
        Maybe. All of the following must be true before I commit to writing you
        a letter:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li
            >You've asked for it at least two weeks in advance of the deadline,
            preferably one month, so I have time to schedule writing.</li
        >
        <li
            >You've given me all of the information you have about what is
            expected in the letter, especially if it is not a conventional
            graduate school application.</li
        >
        <li>You've shared with me why you need the letter.</li>
        <li
            >You've explained why I'm an ideal person in your network to write
            the letter, relative to other options.</li
        >
        <li
            >I've collaborated with you on a project, or if you were a student
            in my class, I've had multiple conversations about things beyond the
            scope of a class and its requirements (e.g., in office hours, in
            research, or other settings).</li
        >
    </ul>

    <p>
        For many students, this is easy to satisfy. For example, postdocs,
        doctoral students, and undergraduate researchers in my research lab
        easily satisfy all of the criteria above. They don't even need to ask if
        I'll write; it's a given. But I receive many requests from students I've
        had in classes that I've <em>never</em> talked to. In these cases, what
        would I even say in the letter?
        <em>"They were in my class, but I don't know them?"</em>
        If you're in that situation, I would love to get to know you, but if I spent
        the time to do that with every student who asked for a letter, I would probably
        be spending more than a dozen hours a week meeting with students just to
        write letters. I definitely cannot do that without failing at my other responsibilities.
    </p>

    <p>Write me and ask if you think you're eligible.</p>

    <p>
        There are some exceptions to the policy above. If the "letter" you need
        is really just a form that I fill out attesting that I had you in class,
        I'm happy to do that. If you just need a reference for a job, I'm happy
        to be a reference; I rarely get called, and when I do, it's rarely
        onerous. And if you're a student in one of our <Link
            to={'/lablets#recommendation'}>lablets</Link
        >, there are specific conditions for earning a letter.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are eligible for a letter, I need the following to help me write
        a good letter:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The deadline</li>
        <li>Where to submit</li>
        <li
            >Details about what the letter is for, preferably a URL to whatever
            you're applying to</li
        >
        <li
            >If we did not interact regularly, a detailed summary of all of our
            interactions, to help prime my memory.</li
        >
    </ul>

<Section
    id="csis"
    header="What is the difference between computer science and informatics at UW?"
>
    <p>
        I think of Computer Science and Informatics like we think about Physics
        versus Engineering: the former concerns itself with a phenomenon as it
        occurs in nature and the latter is concerned with applications of it for
        humanity. CS fundamentally asks what is computing, what can be computed,
        how can it be computed. Informatics fundamentally asks what should be
        computed, how should computation be used, what role does computing play
        in society. If you find computing intrinsically interesting and wouldn't
        mind talking about it endlessly, CS is a great major for you. If you
        just want use it as a tool to solve the world's problems, Informatics is
        a great major for you. Some people are interested in both. Maybe that's
        you! Both are competitive majors, both lead to wonderful jobs, and both
        will teach you a lot about the world, one from the perspective of
        computing, one from the perspective of people and society. Both
        perspectives are necessary and valuable.
    </p>

        You can read more about my view of information and computing in a blog

<Section id="review" header="I was asked to review a paper. Should I?">
    <p>
        My Ph.D. students often ask me whether they should accept a paper review
        request. Here's some of the advice I give them for doing or not doing
        it:
    </p>

    <p>Reasons to do it:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You want to read the paper!</li>
        <li>You need practice critically evaluating papers.</li>
        <li
            >You're one of a handful of people who has the expertise to evaluate
            it. (Academia is small, expertise is rare, it's your duty to
            volunteer).</li
        >
        <li
            >Early in an academic career, it's helpful to show that you've
            reviewed for prestigious journals and conferences.</li
        >
    </ul>

    <p>Reasons not to do it:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You really don't have the expertise.</li>
        <li
            >You've done too much reviewing in the past year and have earned the
            right to say no.</li
        >
        <li
            >You're an experienced paper reviewer and don't need the practice.</li
        >
        <li>You don't have the time due to other reviewing commitments.</li>
        <li>You're overloaded on other service commitments.</li>
    </ul>

    id="evaluation"
    header="How should I evaluate this developer tool I invented?"
>
    <p>
        I often get questions from researchers asking for help to design studies
        to evaluate the developer tool what they've built. I could write a whole
        book on this (and <External
            to="http://www.amazon.com/Research-Methods-Statistics-Psychology-Coolican/dp/0340812583"

        just not on the topic of CS research).
    </p>

    <p>
        For my part, I wrote a journal paper that walks through several
        practical details of evaluating developer tools:

        languages also wrote a well reasoned analysis of <em>claims</em> in
        evaluations called <External
