<h1> These are books I've authored or edited. </h1>

<p>
    Unlike print books, they are digital, searchable, interactive, and web
    accessible. I write them on <Link to="https://bookish.press"
        >Bookish.press</Link
    >, a platform I created to write simple, beautiful, accessible web-based
    books. The books are also living documents: I update them regularly with new
    ideas, citations, and chapters, especially in response to feedback.
