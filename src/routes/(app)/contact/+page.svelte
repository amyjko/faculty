<Alert>
    As Associate Dean for Academics, I have several roles in managing conflict:

    <ul>
        <li
            >I am the school's academic <strong>conduct officer</strong>, which
            means I fact find and make judgements about reports of cheating that
            our faculty escalate.</li
        >
        <li
            >I am one of the school's <strong>conflict facilitators</strong>. If
            you are in a conflict with faculty, staff, or students, you can
            reach out to me, and it's my responsibility to help you find a
            faciliator (possibly me) to resolve the conflict and rebuild trust.</li
        >
        <li
            >I am one of the iSchool's Title IX
            <strong>Officials Required to Report</strong>. If I learn of
            sex/gender-based violence, harassment, or discrimination, I am
            required to
            <Link to="https://www.washington.edu/titleix/report/"
                >submit a report</Link
            >
            to UW's Title IX office, including any names or details I have. This
            does not trigger an investigation; case managers will reach out to victims
            with supportive measures, resources, and how to submit a formal complaint.
            If you're unsure whether to reach out to me I recommend contacting a
            <Link to="https://livewell.uw.edu/survivor-support-advocacy/"
                >UW confidential advocate</Link
            >; they are confidential and trained, and can help you decide what
            action to take next.
        </li></ul

        &mdash; If you're a current UW student, contact me via one of the
        channels below to see if a meeting makes sense. If you're in one my
        classes, see the syllabus for my course office hours. If you're not a UW
        student, write me an email; we'll meet if appropriate.

    {#snippet image()}
        <Image url={'/images/contact/uw.jpg'} alt="The UW block logo." />
    {/snippet}
    &mdash; I primarily use email to communicate with people I don't know and occasionally
    with collaborators who refuse to use anything else. If you're a student, a potential
    collaborator, or anyone else, write me an email to connect. I read email once
    in the morning each weekday. I don't read on weekends unless I'm super engaged
    on a project.

    <span>
        &mdash; Slack is my preferred medium for collaboration with my Ph.D.
        students and other collaborators at UW and beyond. During the work day I
        treat Slack like instant messaging, and after hours I treat it like
        email, reading it in the morning. If you're at UW, join one of the
        Slacks and DM me. I'm usually pretty responsive throughout the day.

    {/snippet}
    &mdash; I used to be fairly active on Twitter, but mostly left in June 2022.
    I still broadcast writing, amplify others, and respond to DMs, but I'm generally
    not posting otherwise. You can find me on <External

    > or Threads <External to="https://www.threads.net/@amyjensenko"
        >@amyjensenko</External

    &mdash; I use LinkedIn as my primary contact manager. I usually only accept connections
    from people I've met IRL and have a professional relationship with (students,
    collaborators, professional colleagues). I read my LinkedIn messages as part
    of my morning email routine.

    &mdash; I primarily use Facebook for non-work relationships (though that boundary
    is blurry). I usually only accept connections from people I've met IRL and have
    a social relationship with, so if I have a purely professional relationship with
    you, please don't be offended if I decline your friend request. Add me on LinkedIn
    instead.

    &mdash; Don't call me on the phone. It's never the right time. Write me on one
    of the platforms above first and we can schedule a call if necessary. If you
    leave a voicemail, I will get it eventually.
