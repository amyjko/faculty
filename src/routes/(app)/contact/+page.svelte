<h1> There are many ways to reach me: </h1>

    <span>
        &mdash; If you're a current UW student, contact me via one of the
        channels below to see if a meeting makes sense. If you're in one my
        classes, see the syllabus for my course office hours. If you're not a UW
        student, write me an email; we'll meet if appropriate.

        alt="The UW block logo."
    />
    &mdash; I primarily use email to communicate with people I don't know and occasionally
    with collaborators who refuse to use anything else. If you're a student, a potential
    collaborator, or anyone else, write me an email to connect. I read email once
    in the morning each weekday. I don't read on weekends unless I'm super engaged
    on a project.

    />
    <span>
        &mdash; Slack is my preferred medium for collaboration with my Ph.D.
        students and other collaborators at UW and beyond. During the work day I
        treat Slack like instant messaging, and after hours I treat it like
        email, reading it in the morning. If you're at UW, join one of the
        Slacks and DM me. I'm usually pretty responsive throughout the day.

        url={'/images/contact/twitter.jpg'}
        alt="The Twitter logo."
    />
    &mdash; I used to be fairly active on Twitter, but mostly left in June 2022.
    I still broadcast writing, amplify others, and respond to DMs, but I'm generally
    not posting otherwise. You can also find me on Mastodon <External
        to="https://hci.social/@amyjko">@amyjko@hci.social</External
    > or Threads <External to="https://www.threads.net/@amyjensenko"
        >@amyjensenko</External

        alt="The Github logo."
    />
    &mdash; I host a lot of my content and software projects on GitHub. Feel free
    to submit issues and pull requests to my various repositories.

    />
    &mdash; I use LinkedIn as my primary contact manager. I usually only accept connections
    from people I've met IRL and have a professional relationship with (students,
    collaborators, professional colleagues). I read my LinkedIn messages as part
    of my morning email routine.

    />
    &mdash; I primarily use Facebook for non-work relationships (though that boundary
    is blurry). I usually only accept connections from people I've met IRL and have
    a social relationship with, so if I have a purely professional relationship with
    you, please don't be offended if I decline your friend request. Add me on LinkedIn
    instead.

    &mdash; Don't call me on the phone. They never come at the right time, I'm rarely
    in my office when you want to reach me. Write me on one of the platforms above
    first and we can schedule a call if necessary. If you leave a voicemail, I will
    get it eventually.
