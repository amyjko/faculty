<h1> This is my computing education research FAQ. </h1>

<p>
    I started it with the help of several computing education researchers at a
    Dagstuhl retreat in 2016. I consider it a community resource, so if you see
    something to add, fix, or improve, write me, or submit <External
        to="https://github.com/amyjko/faculty/issues">an issue</External
    > or
    <External to="https://github.com/amyjko/faculty/pulls"
        >pull request</External
    >.
</p>

<p>
    Computing education research (CER), also known as computer science education
    (CSEd) research, is the study of how people learn and teach computing,
    broadly construed. This FAQ will teach you more about the field and how you
    might contribute to it.
</p>

<Section id="what-is-cer" header="What is computing education research?">
    <p>
        First, CER is not teaching. Teaching is helping people change their
        knowledge, skills, attitudes, beliefs, identities. Research is discovery
        and invention. Teachers teach computing, whereas computing education
        researchers make discoveries about this teaching and learning, and
        invent new ways for these teaching and learning to occur. CER is an
        example of <External
            to="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13362/discipline-based-education-research-understanding-and-improving-learning-in-undergraduate"
            >discipline-based education research</External
        >, like math education research or science education research, all of
        which are part of the broader field of education and learning sciences
        research.
    </p>

    <p>
        CER is also not educational technology research (EdTech). Computing
        education researchers often create educational technologies to support
        the learning and teaching of computing, but CER is not explicitly
        concerned with the broader use of technology in learning, teaching, and
        education. It's specifically concerned with the learning and teaching of
        computing in particular. Many computer science researchers invent
        learning technologies, but are not computing education researchers,
        because those technologies are not concerned with the learning of
        computing.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's also important to note that I view "computing" broadly: it's not
        just about programming, or even just about computer science, but also
        about all of the phenomena surrounding computing, including data,
        information, privacy, security, ethics, software engineering, and
        sociocultural and sociopolitical views of computing in society. This
        means that computing education and CER can and does cover far more than
        just learning to code&mdash;it just hasn't historically.
    </p>
</Section>

<Section
    id="csed-v-cer"
    header="What is the difference between 'CS' and 'computing'?"
>
    <p>
        CS generally refers to the historically core topics in computer science
        research, such as theory, algorithms, data structures, programming
        languages, and operating systems. But other fields began to engage these
        ideas and identify their intersections to other fields. For example,
        information science, a field long concerned with data, information, and
        society, began to consider those topics from a computer science
        perspective. Science began to apply computer science ideas to data
        capture, storage, and analysis. Biology, as it began to see DNA as a
        form of biological data, and apply algorithms to analyzing it, formed
        bioinformatics. Communication began to explore computer-mediated
        communication. Behavioral and brain scientists started using computers
        to model decisions, knowledge, and brain activity. And social scientists
        of all kinds began studying and critiquing the role of computers in
        society.
    </p>

    <p>
        This broadening of algorithms, data structures, and programming to all
        of academia put pressure on "computer science" as a phrase. Some
        universities with CS departments began to grow to teach and study all of
        these broader phenomena, leading many of them to rename themselves
        "Schools of Computing". The word "computing" was meant to refer not to
        physical hardware, but of computation itself and the many ways that it
        occurs and is organized in nature and human civilization. And thus, over
        time, CS began to connote the more narrow historical focus of CS
        foundations and Computing to the broader set of phenomena around the
        design and use of computers, including CS itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given that history, "CS education" generally refers to the teaching and
        learning of these historically narrow topics in CS, and "CS education
        research" to research about this teaching and learning. In contrast,
        "Computing education" generally refers to the teaching and learning of <em
            >any</em
        > aspect of the use of computers and computational ideas, and "Computing
        education research" to research about that teaching and learning. Because
        I'm not interested in the historically narrow conception of computing, and
        my research considers topics outside that narrow historical conception, I
        use "Computing" instead of "CS".
    </p>
</Section>

<Section
    id="comparison-to-other-fields"
    header="How does computing education research compare to related fields?"
>
    <p>
        My background isn't in these fields, though I do collaborate with people
        in these other communities and have learned about their differences.
        Here's the best characterization I can give:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Education research</strong> is broadly concerned with formal
            systems of education, how to make those systems effective and just, how
            to prepare teachers to make them effective and just. The field is interested
            in general theories of learning, education, interest development, and
            identity, and because of its focus on formal education, is often focused
            on youth, who are the dominant age demographic engaged in formal education.
            The phrase "Computing education" uses the word "education" in this same
            way, but is more broadly concerned with teaching and learning in any
            context (in principle, but often not in practice).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Educational psychology</strong> is focused on learning phenomena
            in the mind, such as learning, memory, development, intelligence, self-regulation,
            motivation, and self-concept. The field is also concerned with school
            psychologists who help students with their mental health. The field tends
            to be more quantitative than education research and learning sciences,
            following traditions of cognitive psychology. Computing education draws
            upon this field, especially in its history of cognitive theories of program
            understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Learning sciences</strong> emerged in the 1990's as a reaction
            to educational psychology's inattention to the setting, culture, and
            social context of learning. Combining perspectives from cognition, cognitive
            science, computer science, and design, like education research, it's
            much more concerned with the sociocultural factors that shape learning,
            and more than education and educational psychology, views design as a
            means to articulating theories, a way of shaping theories, and a way
            of testing theories. Because of the focus on context, in addition to
            being concerned with formal systems of education, it is also concerned
            with learning across the lifespan, at home, in families, and other settings.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        (Shayan Doroudi provides a nice <External
            to="https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/shayan-doroudi/blog/learning-theories"
            >primer on learning theories</External
        > and their disciplinary origins.)
    </p>

    <p>
        How does computing education fit in to all of this? Like other <External
            to="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13362/discipline-based-education-research-understanding-and-improving-learning-in-undergraduate"
            >discipline-based education research (DBER)</External
        > such as math and physics education, it draws upon all three of the fields
        above, using theories and ideas from those fields. However, because it is
        focused on a discipline, it is specifically concerned with the content of
        the discipline, specific methods of learning and teaching that content. In
        this sense, it is more applied, bridging foundational ideas that span any
        human learning to applied ideas specific to the learning of specific ideas
        and skills.
    </p>
</Section>

<Section
    id="major-questions"
    header="What are major research questions in CER?"
>
    <p>
        As with any research discipline, research questions can and should be
        specific. However, there are some major overarching questions in this
        field that researchers have begun to investigate, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>What is computing?</li>
        <li>What does it mean to know computing?</li>
        <li>How do people learn computing?</li>
        <li>How do teachers teach and assess computing?</li>
        <li>How does identity interact with people's learning of computing?</li>
        <li>How can people learn computing more effectively?</li>
        <li>How can teachers teach computing more effectively?</li>
        <li>How can access to computing education be improved?</li>
        <li>How can computing education be delivered equitably to all?</li>
        <li
            >How can computing education be reimagined to serve goals other than
            profit and disruption?</li
        >
        <li
            >How do systems of oppression such as racism, sexism, and ablism
            shape learning, teaching, and curricula?</li
        >
        <li>How can we implement anti-racist CS education?</li>
        <li>How can learning technologies teach computing?</li>
        <li>How does computing education affect people's lives?</li>
        <li>What are the societal costs of computing illiteracy?</li>
        <li
            >What can be taught about computing to learners of different ages?</li
        >
    </ul>

    <p>
        While the "people" in the questions above could be anyone (youth, teens,
        college students, adults, and even teachers), the history of CER has
        primarily focused on teaching students in post-secondary settings,
        because the faculty conducting research have found it easier to study
        the students they are teaching. This is changing as countries around the
        world begin to incorporate computing into all levels of school, and as
        private industry begins to create technologies and services that teach
        computing to all ages. For example, my research has investigated new
        ways to teach youth from age 8-18, as well as adults.

<Section
    id="exciting-discoveries"
    header="What are some exciting CER discoveries?"
>
    <p> There are so many! Examples include: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The field discovered that diversity in computing education is low
            because of the narrow, exclusionary nature of computing cultures,
            not because of inherent disinterest or inability on the part of
            diverse learners (e.g., <External
                to="https://doi.org/10.1145/543812.543836"
                >Fisher &amp; Margolis 2002</External
            >, <External
                to="https://books.google.com/books?id=WOI9rGJSFCcC&amp;lpg=PR5&amp;ots=LaGMwwGOZl&amp;dq=swimming%20in%20the%20shallow%20end&amp;lr&amp;pg=PR5#v=onepage&amp;q=swimming%20in%20the%20shallow%20end&amp;f=false"
                >Margolis 2010</External
            >).
        </li>
        <li>
            The field invented contextualized computing ed pedagogy (e.g., Mark
            Guzdial's <External to="https://doi.org/10.1145/961290.961542"
                >media computation</External
            >), which has greatly increased the diversity of computer science
            graduates, and spread to many universities.
        </li>
        <li>
            The field built upon the earliest structured editors like the <External
                to="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358755"
                >Cornell Program Synthesizer</External
            >, eventually maturing them into block-based editing environments
            like <External to="https://doi.org/10.1145/259963.260503"
                >Alice</External
            >, <External to="https://doi.org/10.1145/1592761.1592779"
                >Scratch</External
            > and <External to="https://developers.google.com/blockly/"
                >Blockly</External
            >. These editors greatly increased engagement in computing
            education, and greatly reduced barriers to learning programming
            languages.
        </li>
        <li>
            Seymour Papert, who was broadly concerned with learning, but also
            the learning of computing, contributed constructionism, a new theory
            of learning (<External
                to="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1095592"
                >Papert 1980</External
            >).
        </li>
        <li>
            Alan Kay, one of the earliest researchers to investigate the
            learning of computing, helped <External
                to="http://gagne.homedns.org/~tgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html"
                >build upon ideas of object-orientation from Simula</External
            >, which inspired Smalltalk, which along with other languages such
            as C++, inspired the modern object-oriented programming languages
            and IDEs we use today.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The field's recent efforts to transform STEM education through
        computing, invent rapid new forms of learning online, and devise more
        equitable ways to teach should be equally, if not more impactful.
    </p>
</Section>

<Section id="jobs" header="What jobs can computing education researchers get?">
    <p>
        Most computing education researchers are faculty in universities. Many
        of these faculty are tenure-track faculty like myself, which means a
        substantial portion of our time (~50%) is spent on scholarship. However,
        there are also many full-time instructors who find additional time to do
        research on top of their teaching. Many of the original authors at ICER
        were once members of the Bootstrapping or Scaffolding groups (led by
        Fincher, Petre, and Tenenberg), who were CS teachers that started to do
        research in their own classrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not all computing education researchers are college faculty. Some work
        in industry creating educational technologies for teaching computing,
        applying their expertise to the research and design of educational
        software. Some work in non-profits, using their expertise to advocate
        for computing education in schools, while conducting research on factors
        that affect policy. Some work in school districts, helping to implement
        computing education curricula in schools, while studying and evaluating
        the effectiveness of the implementation. Others work in government,
        facilitating research funding. Others still become teachers themselves,
        both at universities and other schools.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tenure-track faculty are in the best position to make advances in the
        field because a substantial portion of their time is dedicated to
        research, but the research contributions by teaching-track faculty are
        critical, as they often bring more richly informed perspectives on the
        practice of teaching. It is possible to do research in other positions,
        but it is often outside the scope of a job. Because of this, many
        non-tenure track faculty focus their research on settings that their job
        gives them access to, which can restrict which research questions they
        can answer.
    </p>
</Section>

<Section id="becoming-a-researcher" header="How do I become a CER researcher?">
    <p>
        The most effective route is to get a Ph.D. in computing education
        research at one of the many Ph.D. granting universities in the world.
        Ph.D. students learn to conduct research over the course of multiple
        years (generally 4 to 6) under the supervision of an advisor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Undergraduate research is a key part of creating pathways to Ph.D.
        programs. Undergraduates can help accelerate research projects, and even
        lead their own projects, helping with admission to Ph.D. programs
        (especially if you publish, which demonstrates your interest and ability
        in conducting research). See the <External
            to="https://cra.org/crae/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/10/Resources-for-Scaling-Undergraduate-Research.pdf"
            >CRA-E best practices guide on undergraduate CS research</External
        > for a glimpse into how effective undergraduate research experiences should
        work.
    </p>
</Section>

<Section id="getting-a-phd" header="Where can I get a Ph.D. in CER?">
    <p>
        You need to find a university that grants Ph.D.s and has tenure-track
        faculty who do research in CER on a topic that you're interested in. The
        alphabetical list below contains some of the many faculty who advise
        Ph.D. students on computing education research. Find them online and see
        what kind of research they're doing. (This list may be out of date, as
        faculty sometimes move universities, retire, go to industry, or change
        research areas, so be sure to check their website for the latest
        information).
    </p>

    <p>
        One common question is whether to get a Ph.D. in a CS department, a
        College of Education, or some other kind of computing or learning
        related department, such as information schools, which are often
        concerned with computing and data literacy. Ultimately, the doctoral
        program you choose is going to shape a few things: 1) the classes you're
        required to take in the first year or two, 2) the peers you might sit
        near and talk to, 3) the faculty who might serve on your committee and
        what expertise and values they have, and 4) what resources you have to
        get particular kinds of jobs. For example, if you go to a CS Ph.D.
        program, you're going to learn about the latest research in various
        areas of CS, be surrounded by people interested in computing, but
        possibly not many interested in computing education; you'll have
        resources for getting faculty jobs in CS departments, but not really
        Colleges of Education. In contrast, if you go to a College or School of
        Education Ph.D. program, you're going to learn about the latest
        knowledge in education and learning sciences, and be surrounded by
        people passionate about learning, equity, and justice, but possibly not
        many people interested in computing. And if you go to a place like an
        information school, you'll gain new perspectives about data and
        computing, be surrounded by a radical diversity of people with interests
        that span many disciplines, but possibly one of only a few people
        interested in computing education.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because of the tradeoffs above, the best places to go are ones where
        there are advisors that share your interests, a critical mass of people
        interested in computing education, and healthy interchange between
        academic units interested in computing, learning, and data. This is
        because computing education is inherently interdisciplinary; you want
        peers and faculty that appreciate that, value that, and support that.
    </p>

    <p>
        One note about selecting advisors: their disciplinary affiliation is
        just <em>one</em> indicator of the nature of the contributions they might
        make (people in CS departments might built learning technologies, people
        in colleges of education might focus on teacher training and pedagogy), but
        this is not a perfect indicator. Look closely at researchers' recent publications;
        and if their websites seem out of date, write them to ask what they're working
        on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another caveat: some of the faculty below have chosen their expertise
        descriptions, but others I had to extract from faculty websites wrote.
        <strong>I've put a * next to expertise</strong> that hasn't been chosen or
        agreed to by the researcher being described. These expertise tags are also
        likely to be perpetualy out of date, as researchers pursue new topics. The
        best thing to do is click on their name to visit their website and see what
        kinds of research they have published. That's the most direct indicator of
        their interests, the methods they use, and the types of contributions they
        want to make (other than just writing them and asking, which you can also
        do).

        Advisors differ on the criteria they use to select candidates.
        Personally, I look for 1) experience with research, 2) passion in the
        subject of computing education, 3) the requisite skills to pursue that
        passion, and 4) an overlap with my interests. You can get experience by
        working with faculty at your own institution. That can be hard if you
        don't have faculty doing work in this area. The requisite skills depend
        a lot on the contributions you want to make. If you want to envision and
        build new learning technologies, can you code well enough to build them?
        If you want to investigate new teacher training methods, do you have
        teaching experience? If you want to do more theoretical work, how strong
        are your writing and analytical skills? All of these skills end up being
        important in some way to participating in CER discourse, just to varying
        degrees.
    </p>

    <p>
        Working specifically in computing education isn't necessary to achieve
        the above. Perhaps you have undergraduate research experience in HCI,
        software engineering, or programming languages. That can be fine, as
        long as your passion is clear and the skills you have align with the
        questions you want to answer. Researchers are always investigating new
        questions, so it's perfectly normal to have experience from other
        related areas of computing and information science.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course, even if you meet all of the criteria above (or other criteria
        that other advisors might have), you might not get accepted. That's
        because doctoral advising is extremely time-intensive: we commit to
        advise people for anywhere from 3-6 years or more, and so we can only
        take on so many students at a time. There might be a dozen people who
        apply to work with one of us, but we only have capacity to admit one or
        two at most.

<Section id="funding-for-cer" header="Is there funding for CER?">
    <p>
        Yes! At least in the U.S., Ph.D. students are generally funded by the
        research grants their advisors obtain, and can also receive NSF Graduate
        Research Fellowships, which cover three years of tuition and stipend.
        Undergraduates can participate in NSF-sponsored Research Experience for
        Undergraduate projects that faculty sponsor. CER faculty can also apply
        for NSF CAREER grants on computing education research, or an <External

>
    <p>
        First, you need to know some computing yourself. That doesn't mean you
        need an entire computer science degree, but it helps to have learned to
        code a bit, and to understand what an algorithm and a data structure is.
        It can also help to understand the culture of computer science as an
        academic discipline. Taking the first few introductory courses in a CS
        department is usually enough to provide this content knowledge
        foundation, unless you want to do research on the teaching of more
        advanced topics in CS.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another thing to know is what makes good computing education research.
        One guide is to read peer review criteria. For example, ACM TOCE
        maintains and evolves a list of <External
            to="https://github.com/acm-toce/documentation/wiki/Reviewing-Criteria"
            >nuanced and pluralist peer review criteria</External
        > that cover many kinds of research.
    </p>

    <p>
        Beyond that, there is a substantial prior work to learn before you can
        make original discoveries. I've organized some of the major works into
        categories below, to focus your reading.
    </p>

    <h4 id="foundations">Education research foundations</h4>

    <p>
        As computing education research is a discipline-based kind of education
        research, foundations in education research are key. Below are essential
        works for conducting research on learning and teaching:

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="race">Race and Technology</h4>

    <p>
        While not specifically about computing education, these books critically
        examine the role of computing in justice. The ideas in these books are
        key to understanding the social implications of computing on society. I
        focus on race in particular because race, at least in the United States,
        has structured injustice more heavily than all other social categories,
        making it critical to understanding the effects of computing.

        research, helping you to more quickly learn what the field has

            dozen other leading researchers with the goal of creating the definitive
            introduction to the field. It is reflective of prior work, for better
            or worse, going deeply into pedagogy, but only briefly (but elegantly)
            addressing issues of racism, sexism, and inclusion. Therefore, it should
            not be viewed as a vision for the future of the field, but rather a reflection
            of its past.</li

    <p>
        Most academic fields have exclusively academic venues for publication,
        with few practitioners participating in or reading the research that
        researchers produce. The CER community is unique (and I believe quite
        fortunate) in that practitioners are deeply involved in the academic
        research community (partly because most faculty conducting research are
        teachers themselves). Below I note several conferences and journals
        where you can publish computing education research (see SIGCSE for <External
            to="http://sigcse.org/sigcse/resources/publish"
            >a broader list</External
        >). Note that I separate the pure research venues from the venues that
        combine both research and practice since the combined venues are often
        dominated by practioners, which can make it hard to have focused
        research conversations and rigorous peer review.

<Section id="sigcse" header="What is SIGCSE?">
    <p>
        <External to="http://sigcse.org/">SIGCSE</External>, like other ACM
        Special Interest Groups (SIGs), is an organization that focuses on a
        particular topic within ACM, namely computer science education. It
        sponsors ACM conferences (e.g., the SIGCSE Technical Symposium and ICER)
        and influences their structure and focus. Note that SIGCSE the group
        organizes SIGCSE the conference. I know, it's confusing, but aren't you
        glad you read this?
    </p>

<Section
    id="experience-reports"
    header="What's the difference between a research paper and an experience report?"
>
    <p>
        This is an important question, since many of the conference venues in
        the computing education community publish both. Unfortunately, the
        community hasn't developed much clarity about the differences between
        these. The result is that many papers published in the SIGCSE experience
        report track look like research papers, and many of the papers published
        in the SIGCSE research track look like experience reports. What's the
        essential difference?
    </p>

    <p>
        In my opinion, the key distinction between research and an experience
        report is your audience, which implies your goals: are you writing to
        researchers, who aspire to build upon everything we know to advance
        theories about what we know about CS teaching and learning? In contrast,
        if you're writing to teachers, you're likely sharing practical
        knowledge, such as an interesting method you tried, a surprising
        experience, or a teaching method others might experiment with. The
        critical difference is that in research, we're trying to be certain that
        we know something, but it's okay if we don't know how to put that
        knowledge into action yet, whereas in practice, we're trying to learn
        how to teach something, even if we're not certain it will work. Another
        way to characterize the difference are some of the evaluation criteria.
        Research papers should be <em
            >novel with respect to everything we know</em
        >
        and <em>sound</em>, but not necessarily immediately useful. Experience
        report papers should be <em>novel with respect to common knowledge</em>
        (but not necessarily novel with respect to all knowledge),
        <em>useful</em>
        and <em>interesting</em>, but not necessarily sound.
    </p>

    <p>
        I believe that both are valuable in their own ways. Research allows us
        to build confidence in what we know, whereas sharing experience allows
        us to teach each other. We need both for a thriving practice of CS
        teaching and a thriving body of knowledge to inform that practice.
