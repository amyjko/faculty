<h1> My students and I receive funding from many sources. </h1>

    &mdash; My lab's primary source of funding is the University of Washington Information
    School. It pays 9 months of my salary, it subsidizes my doctoral students' time
    through teaching assistantships, it provides space and staff support, and it
    provides my core intellectual community. The iSchool's resources come from tuition,
    fees, taxes from the Washington state government, and philanthropic giving.

    {/snippet}
    &mdash; The majority of my sponsored research is funded by the U.S. National
    Science Foundation, which is tax-funded. I write proposals, which are confidentially
    evaluated by my peers, and when my peers and NSF find my proposals to have compelling
    intellectual merit and potential for broader impact, I receive grants. I use
    these grants to support my summer salary, my doctoral students stipends, benefits,
    and tuition, my lab's research expenses, hourly undergraduate research assistants,
    and our travel. My doctoral students also write their own proposals, often winning
    NSF graduate research fellowships to support the first 3 years of their doctoral
    work. My NSF awards include:
    <ul>
        {#each $profile.getFunding( (funding) => funding.funder === 'National Science Foundation' && !funding.private, (funding) => (funding.commitment.end === null ? -Infinity : -parseDate(funding.commitment.end).getFullYear()) ) as award}
            <li>
                {#if award.url}
                    <External to={award.url}>{award.title}</External>
                {:else}
                    {award.title}
                {/if}
            </li>
        {/each}
    </ul>
    Six of my 13 past and present doctoral students have also won NSF Graduate Research
    Fellowships, which support three years of their research.

        />
    {/snippet}
    &mdash; Occasionally, collaborators across Microsoft, such as those in Microsoft
    Research and Microsoft's developer division, will give me unrestricted gifts
    to support my lab. These are no strings attached contributions, which I rely
    on for expenses that the iSchool and NSF will not support, such as buying out
    of teaching to free up research time and unplanned research expenses.

    {/snippet}
    &mdash; In the past, I have received unrestricted Google research grants that
    generally support 1-year projects that support me and a doctoral student.

    &mdash; When my doctoral students or I have collaborated with Adobe researchers,
    they have given unrestricted gifts in support of my lab. This funding comes with
    no strings attached.
