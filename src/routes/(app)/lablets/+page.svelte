<Alert>
    Amy is on sabbatical. Please check the spreadsheet below to see if any of
    her postdocs or PhD students are organizing lablets this quarter.

<Alert>
    Lablets are an experimental model for engaging undergraduate and masters
    students research. Because it's an experiment, don't expect perfect
    processes or preparation or consistent offerings. Email or Slack Amy if you
    have questions.
</Alert>

<p>
    Every year, dozens of students reach out to my lab to participate, but we
    don't have the capacity to meaningfully mentor everyone who wants to join.
    To offer more students the opportunity to learn about computing education
    research while respecting our limited time, we occasionally will offer a <strong
        >lablet</strong
    > to engage University of Washington students in our lab's research community.
</p>

<p> Here are the goals of lablets: </p>

<ul>
    <li
        ><em
            >Help students develop interest in computing education research and
            teaching.</em
        > If you join a lablet, we commit to helping you develop your interests.</li
    >
    <li
        ><em
            >Offer clear protocols for participation and pathways for deeper
            engagement.</em
        > It should always be clear what participation means; no hidden curriculum.</li
    >
    <li
        ><em>Ensure any barriers we create are beneficial.</em> We'll have to create
        some barriers to avoid overwhelming Amy and her doctoral students, but any
        barriers do create should be helpful in some way.</li
    >
</ul>

<Linkable id="whatisalablet">What is a lablet?</Linkable>

<p> A lablet is: </p>

<ul>
    <li
        >A group of undergraduates and masters students who self-organize around
        a common interest, that...</li
    >
    <li
        >Meets weekly to read, discuss, and apply research on a particular
        topic, and that...</li
    >
    <li>Starts and ends on a quarterly basis, and that...</li>
    <li
        >Led by one or more students elected by majority by the members of the
        lablet, and is...</li
    >
    <li>Supervised by either Amy, a postdoc, or a doctoral student.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Lablets run separately from the main lab meetings. Activities include weekly
    meetings, reading groups, activism, tutorials, and discussion. It's up to
    the leader and supervisor to ensure meaningful activities, maintaining a
    weekly agenda. We provide <External
        to="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ziwgmDBdCNY1AbhlQti8hgabwhVhwvRpL8xPjknywnQ/edit#gid=1849819586"
        >meeting templates</External
    > for many of the above activities to help you understand roles and expectations.
    However, you're always welcome to deviate from them, or suggest improvements
    to them, by writing Amy a DM in <External
        to="http://computinged-uw.slack.com">Slack</External
    >.
</p>

<Linkable id="whatlablets">What lablets are being offered?</Linkable>
<p>
    Below are the past and future lablets. Note that we don't necessarily offer
    one every quarter; it depends on our availability.

<p>
    You can see when the lablets (and main lab meeting) are scheduled by
    subscribing to our lab calendar (add <strong>codeandcognition@uw.edu</strong

</p>

<Linkable id="1styear"
    >Can I join as a 1st year student with no research experience?</Linkable
>

<p>
    Yes, definitely. That's exactly why we started doing lablets &mdash; to give
    students a front door to learning about research.
</p>

<Linkable id="whylablet">Why would I want to join a lablet?</Linkable>

<p> There are many reasons! </p>

<ul>
    <li
        ><em>To learn about research</em>. By reading and talking about
        research, you'll learn the difference between research and practice.</li
    >
    <li
        ><em>To find students with shared interests</em>. Lablets bringing
        together students with shared interests.</li
    >
    <li
        ><em>To join the Code &amp; Cognition lab</em>. Lablets are a great way
        to learn about opportunities in the lab; the active lablet leaders are
        invited to join the main lab meetings and get advising from Amy and
        other lab members.</li
    >
    <li
        ><em>To prepare for doctoral studies and applied research careers.</em
        ></li
    >
</ul>

<p>Lablet members may:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Participate in all lablet activities.</li>
    <li
        >Join the first main lab meeting of each quarter to meet Amy and the
        rest of her lab.</li
    >
    <li
        >Post in <External to="http://computinged-uw.slack.com"
            >ComputingEd@UW Slack</External
        > #codeandcognitionlab</li
    >
    <li>
        Earn 1 credit by registering for <External

            >instructions for registering for INFO 499</External
        >; your proposal only needs to mention that you'll be participating in a
        lablet and the required reflection.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    To encourage focus and discourage overcommitment, you can only be part of <strong
        >one</strong
    > lablet at a time. But you can participate for as many quarters as you like
    (assuming we're offering one every quarter.)
</p>

<Linkable id="howmuchtime">How much time does a lablet require?</Linkable>

<p>
    Lablets are a minimum of 1 hour per week (a weekly 50 minute meeting).
    However, to make the most of them, you'll want to have at least a few hours
    a week to contribute to whatever activities a lablet decides to engage in.
    It's okay if you're busier some weeks and more available others, or
    unavailable sometimes. They are not intended to be intense high-commitment
    activities, just a gentle introduction to computing education research.
    Don't join one if you don't have the time to engage.
</p>

<p>
    Because lablets are such a small time committment, it is generally not
    possible to engage in main lab research projects, or even to start research
    projects in the lablet. There simply isn't enough time. I recommend using
    lablets as a way to learn about research, and then if you like it, pursuing
    more intensive research experiences, especially in summer.

    >
</ol>

<Linkable id="howtocreate">When do lablets run?</Linkable>

<p>
    We will try to have at least one lablet each Autumn, Winter, and Spring
    quarters. This depends on the availability and interest of lablet
    supervisors. We do not have plans to run lablets over summer; we reserve
    that for a few full-time undergraduate researchers. Lablets are a good way
    to prepare for summer research opportunities!
</p>

<p>
    You can join a lablet at any time, even part way through a quarter. These
    aren't classes, just informal gatherings.
</p>

<Linkable id="howtocreate">Do lablet topics change?</Linkable>

<p>
    Always! They shift based on the interests of the supervisor and of the
    participants. In fact, we might even rename them in the middle of the
    quarter if a topic goes beyond its title.
</p>

<Linkable id="howtocreate">How do I create a lablet?</Linkable>

<p> Follow these steps: </p>

<ol>
    <li>First join a lablet. (There's always at least one.)</li>
    <li
        >First check the <External
            to="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ziwgmDBdCNY1AbhlQti8hgabwhVhwvRpL8xPjknywnQ/edit#gid=0"
            >active lablets</External
        > to ensure there isn't a suitable lablet to join already.</li
    >
    <li
        >If you see a need for a new lablet, read the responsibilities in the
        question below to ensure you are willing to commit to the job.</li
    >
    <li
        >If you're willing, write Amy with your lablet proposal and she'll try
        to find a supervisor for it.</li
    >
    <li
        >If the lablet is approved by Amy and she finds a supervisor, she will
        introduce you to your supervisor, who will share an onboarding.</li
    >
    <li
        >Ask your supervisor to create a room in the <External
            to="https://ohyay.co/s/codeandcognition"
            >Code and Cognition Ohyay</External
        > and give you admin permissions to design it.</li
    >
    <li
        >Run your lablet, recruiting other students to join! You're welcome to
        use #codeandcognition to recruit.</li
    >
</ol>

<p>
    A good lablet should have a clear purpose. Why does it exist? Who does it
    serve? Does it have a particular goal, such networking or learning?
    Communicate all of these things at the beginning of a lablet, whenever new
    students join, and whenever the goals change.
</p>

<Linkable id="labletleaders">What does a lablet leader have to do?</Linkable>

<p> Lablet leaders must: </p>

<ul>
    <li
        >Host weekly meetings, facilitate lablet activities, and communicate
        regularly with lablet members.</li
    >
    <li
        >Talk regularly with the lablet supervisor to brainstorm activities (DMs
        in Slack are okay).</li
    >
    <li>Set a quarterly goal when forming the lablet.</li>
    <li
        >Post a weekly progress report about lablet activities in
        #codeandcognition. This helps other lab and lablet members identify
        opportunities to talk.</li
    >
</ul>

<p>Lablet leaders may:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Join the main lab meetings.</li>
    <li>Propose research projects to the lab.</li>
</ul>

<Linkable id="labletsupervisors">What does a lablet supervisor do?</Linkable>

<p> Lablet supervisors must: </p>

<ul>
    <li
        >Be a postdoc, doctoral student, or UW faculty member engaged in
        computing education research or practice.</li
    >
    <li
        >Facilitate selecting a lablet leader. Avoid co-leaders, as this results
        in diffuse responsibility, but consider rotating leaders every few weeks
        if multiple students are interested.</li
    >
    <li>Check in weekly with the lablet leader.</li>
    <li
        >Participate in lablet meetings, acting as an on-demand resource,
        consultant, expert, and perhaps notetaker, allowing the lablet leader to
        take the leadership role.</li
    >
    <li
        >Intervene in groups to offer advice, question assumptions, offer
        suggestions.</li
    >
    <li
        >Offer guidance on research, research design, research methods, and
        reading research papers.</li
    >
    <li>Meet with Amy before each quarter to set expectations.</li>
    <ii
        >Check in weekly on #lablets-supervisors with other supervisor on
        lablets activities, offering suggestions for improvement.</ii
    >
</ul>

<p> About 3 weeks before each quarter, lablet leaders should: </p>
<ul>
    <li
        >Ensure that there's an Ohyay meeting space for the lablet with a link
        to the meeting minutes.</li
    >
    <li
        >Ensure that there's a channel in Slack for the lablet and that everyone
        signed up for it is added to the channel.</li
    >
    <li>Ensure that there's a meeting minutes document for the lablet.</li>
    <li
        >Post a poll in the Slack to determine a meeting time for the next
        quarter. (Avoid Mondays since those are often university holidays).</li
    >
    <li>Announce the meeting time no later than 1 week before the quarter.</li>
    <li
        >Add the meeting to the Code and Cognition lab calendar so that everyone
        can discover the meeting time.</li
    >
</ul>

<Linkable id="leave">How do I leave a lablet or move to a new one?</Linkable>
<p>
    If at any point you no longer want to be in your lablet, you may write your
    leader to let them know. At the end of each quarter, Amy will post a lablet
    refresh request to solicit updates to lablet membership. If you don't reply,
    we'll mark you inactive and consider you withdrawn. If everyone leaves the
    lablet, then the lablet is over.
</p>

<Linkable id="evaluate">How do you monitor lablet activity?</Linkable>

<p>
    Supervisors will conduct a quarterly lablet health check, sending a report
    to Amy each quarter. The report will comment on lablet engagement, clarity
    of focus, and confidence in lablet leadership. Amy may use this information
    to restructure lablets for the following quarter.
</p>

<Linkable id="codeofconduct">How am I expected to behave in a lablet?</Linkable>

<p> All lablet members are subject to the following code of conduct: </p>

<ul>
    <li
        >Respect people's name, pronouns, identity, health, wellbeing, agency,
        worth, dignity, and safety.</li
    >
    <li
        >Respect for the above should come before lab activities and priorities;
        learning and research cannot happen without the psychological safety
        conferred by the above.</li
    >
    <li
        >All lab activities must be conducted with integrity: there shall be no
        plagiarism of writing, no fabrication of data, no misrepresentation of
        results, no sharing of ideas without proper attribution and credit.</li
    >
    <li>
        If anyone in a lablet notices violations of the code above, they can and
        should report it to either the lablet leader, the lablet supervisor,
        Amy, or anyone else in the lab they trust. No one should struggle
        through conflicts in isolation; we want to help.
    </li>
</ul>

<Linkable id="recommendation"
    >Can I get a letter of recommendation for participating?</Linkable
>
<p>
    Letters of recommendation are a common request for scholarships,
    recognitions, and graduate school, and unfortunately they can be very hard
    to acquire! And there's a reason for this: faculty like Amy are asked to
    write hundreds a year, and if she said yes to all of them, she'd have no
    time to do the rest of her job. Therefore, Amy has generally reserved
    letters for students with whom she's had sustained, direct interactions with
    over a significant period of time.
</p>

<p> Do lablets count? Here's the policy we're going to try: </p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If you <em>participated</em> in a lablet, but did not interact with Amy
        in a sustained way over a significant period of time, she will write a
        <strong>templated</strong> letter that explains what lablets are, confirms
        that you participated in one, and include a personalized statement from your
        lablet supervisor. This won't be a very helpful letter, since it will read
        as a slightly personalized form letter, but it will at least indicate participation,
        interest, and help you meet whatever unreasonable and oppressive requirements
        some employer or school has set about letters.</li
    >
    <li>
        If you <em>led</em> a lablet, Amy will meet with you, discuss your experiences
        and interests, and write a short letter. This will be more valuable than
        the templated letter above.
    </li>
</ul>

<p> If you're looking for a letter, lead. </p>

<Linkable id="otherparticipation"
    >Are there other ways I can participate in the lab other than lablets?</Linkable
>

<p> Yes, there are several! </p>

<ul>
    <li>
        We recruit undergraduates for full-time paid summer research positions
        each Winter through the <External
            to="https://dub.washington.edu/gettinginvolved.html#tab_prospective"
            >DUB REU program</External
        >. Participating in a lablet is a great way to be competitive for one of
        those slots.
    </li>
    <li>
        We will occasionally hire undergraduates and masters students for
        focused work on a project such as development, maintenance, or data
        analysis. We'll post announcements about that to the
        #codeandcognitionlab channel and elsewhere.
    </li>
    <li>
        Other members of the lab may organize informal research activities or
        recruit volunteers. You can always ask to see if there are
        opportunities.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>
    If any part of that policy isn't clear, let Amy know and she will clarify
    it.
</p>
