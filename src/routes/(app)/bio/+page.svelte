<Linkable id="irreverent">Irreverent Bio</Linkable>

<p>
    Amy J. Ko is a queer, trans anti-disciplinary weirdo at the <External
        to="http://www.washington.edu">University of Washington</External
    > who has the privilege of being paid to follow her curiosity about computation,
    learning, and politics, and tell people what she finds in various rooms, physical
    and virtual. She likes working with students to wander about asking questions
    about the ways that computation has and hasn't woven itself through people's
    lives and learning. She started off inventing ways of making programming easier
    for developers, but then got disillusioned with capitalism. She then got excited
    about the ways that programmers interact with communities of people using their
    code. After she returned from her profit-laced time as CTO, she decided to focus
    on making people smarter instead of tools smarter, and began studying what kinds
    of computing literacies might lead to a more just world, and what kinds of teachers,
    teaching, and tools we need to make that happen. She's grateful to <External
        to="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</External
    > and
    <External to="http://www.oregonstate.edu">Oregon State University</External>
    for being reasonably safe spaces to bumble through the world's endless expanse
    of mysteries as a student, and to the many students and taxpayers that pay her
    to keep doing it as a professor in Seattle.
</p>

<Linkable id="age">Age</Linkable>

<p>
    Why would I put a section on this page about my age? There are so many
    reasons. First, people are constantly assuming I'm much younger than I am
    (which I guess is to be expected, since I have a young face, but must we
    really assume?) Second, when I tell people my age, they're often skeptical
    (which is ridiculous, because I'm pretty sure I know my age better than they
    do). Third, in ageist academia, much of how I'm treated and how my ideas are
    treated are dependent on how people perceive my expertise, experience, and
    wisdom. Looking young is almost guaranteed to lead less thoughtful academics
    to assume I'm a student, that I know nothing, and that I have no expertise
    to share. Hence this section on this page.
</p>

<p>
    So how old am I? I was born in the summer of 1980. I am an Gen Xer. The
    music of my childhood came with big hair and melodrama. I spent a whole
    summer earning and saving $99 to buy a first generation Nintendo. Childhood
    meant going wherever I wanted with whomever I wanted after school with no
    parental consequences. I was one of the first people on the consumer
    internet. My adolescence was defined by pervasive grunge, sadness, suicide,
    comic book stores, arcades, and Magic the Gathering tournaments. I look back
    to the 80's and 90's and wonder how the world got so complicated, so
    quickly. And then I remember that it was always complicated, whiteness just
    demanded we deny that.
</p>

<p>
    So let my face be a reminder: you <em>cannot</em> judge someone's age, life experience,
    expertise, or wisdom from their face.

    These are the documents I submitted for tenure-track faculty positions in
    2008, for my tenure and promotion to Associate Professor, and for my later
    promotion to Professor. I hope they're helpful to anyone pursuing a career
    in academia. While you read them, remember: careers come together one day at
    a time, one paper at a time, not all at once! I've felt imposter syndrome
    most of my life because people didn't tell me this.

<Linkable id="identity">Identity</Linkable>

<p>
    Labels are are often used to stereotype, categorize, and oppress. However,
    when we use them to describe ourselves, they can be powerful ways to develop
    cultural humility, preventing stereotyping and assumptions, as well as
    signal safety. Here are a few labels that I use to describe myself and what
    they mean to me:
</p>

<ul>
    <li
        ><strong>I am an Oregonian</strong>. Growing up in a suburb of Portland,
        Oregon in the 80's and 90's, my values were shaped by environmental
        sustainability, native sovereignty, natural beauty, angst, whiteness,
        and weirdness.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am a Seattleite</strong>. Having frequented Seattle since
        childhood and lived here since 2008, I experience this as being
        progressive, ambitious, perpetually insecure about my wokeness, and
        civically engaged.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am a professor</strong>. I center curiosity, discovery,
        knowledge, learning, and teaching, in work and in life.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am a parent</strong>. I embrace lifelong responsibility for
        the love and wellbeing of my daughter.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am a partner</strong>. I devote my life to cultivating love,
        joy, laughter, shared dreams with my wife.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am a technophile</strong>. Technology is my obsession, both
        its wondrous powers and its potential for destruction.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am a foodophile</strong>. Food shapes my travel, my
        experiences, my conversations. I love food!</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am a woman</strong>. Much of this means being treated as a
        woman, but also having to dismantle sexist cultures, assumptions, and
        traditions that limit my opportunities.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am transgender</strong>. I experience dissonance between my
        body and my gender, and the unjust treatment in law and life that comes
        with a transphobic world.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am queer</strong>. My sex, sexual orientation, and gender
        identity don't really fit the false gender binaries popular in dominant
        culture.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am Chinese</strong>. My father's parents came to the United
        States in the early 20th century, and brought with them cultural
        traditions in food, frugality, and financial security, which shaped my
        own traditions.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am Danish</strong>, at least in ancestry; my mother's parents
        came to the United States in early 20th century, and brought with them
        humility, privacy, and piety.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am a divorcee</strong>. This has eroded my friendships,
        community, finances, and wellbeing, leaving lifelong scars and stigma.</li
    >
    <li
        ><strong>I am an atheist</strong>. I find my spirituality in human
        values and the unknown, but do not believe there is an all powerful
        being that designed the universe.</li
    >
</ul>

<Linkable id="long">Long Bio</Linkable>

<p>
    I was born in <External
        to="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Ontario,+Oregon&sll=37.788081,-104.501953&sspn=38.763291,54.931641&ie=UTF8&z=13&iwloc=addr"
        >Ontario, Oregon</External
    >, but grew up primarily in <External
        to="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=west+linn&sll=44.024804,-116.975703&sspn=0.069492,0.107288&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=addr"
        >West Linn, Oregon</External
    >, a suburb of Portland, and went to <External
        to="http://www.wlhs.wlwv.k12.or.us/">West Linn High School</External
    >. The school was fantastic and I had wonderful teachers, especially in
    math, science, and English. I spent much of my free time playing video games
    with friends, drawing, and writing code in BASIC, Pascal, C, and my TI-85 to
    make visualizations, games, and user interface toolkits. I retreated into
    programming largely as a refuge from myself.
</p>

<p>
    I was a strong student and was admitted to several great universities out of
    state, but I couldn't afford any of them. I attended <External
        to="http://oregonstate.edu/">Oregon State University</External
    >, where I majored in <External to="http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/"
        >Computer Science</External
    > and <External to="http://oregonstate.edu/cla/psychology/"
        >Psychology</External
    >. Early on, I got involved in the budding student chapter of the ACM, and
    after my first year, helped run the club and its activities around campus,
    including the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, a statewide
    software engineering contest, and a student taught course on 2D graphics
    rendering algorithms. At the same time, I joined <External
        to="http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~burnett/"
        >Margaret Burnett</External
    >'s research group, and stayed for two years. In my senior year, I focused
    on my honors thesis project, advised largely by <External
        to="http://www.docbob.ca/">Bob Uttl</External
    >. I'd enjoyed doing research in computer science and psychology so much, I
    decided to apply to several graduate schools with a slant towards
    Human-Computer Interaction.
</p>

<p>
    Of all of the schools, the <External to="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/"
        >Human-Computer Interaction Institute</External
    > at <External to="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</External>
    was the best fit, and I started work right away with <External
        to="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bam/">Brad Myers</External
    >. I started by investigating what made debugging so difficult, and
    inventing technologies to make it easier. Just after proposing in 2006, I
    did a fantastic internship at <External
        to="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx"
        >Microsoft Research</External
    > in the <External to="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/hip/"
        >Human Interactions in Programming</External
    > group, and became fascinated with the larger challenge of software design and
    all of the human and cooperative issues that make it such a challenging form
    of engineering practice. I graduated with my Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction
    in May of 2008.
</p>

<p>
    Just prior to graduating, I toured the country, giving invited talks and job
    interviews at labs and universities for about eight weeks. I interviewed at
    a range of places, including from conservative CS departments like <External
        to="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley EECS</External
    > to much broader places like the <External to="http://ischool.uw.edu/"
        >University of Washington Information School</External
    >, as well as <External
        to="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx"
        >Microsoft Research</External
    >, Redmond. In the end, I wanted to be in the Pacific Northwest, I wanted a
    strong mix of teaching and research, and I was fascinated by the challenge
    of helping to grow and envision a new academic unit, so I chose the <External
        to="http://ischool.uw.edu/">Information School</External
    > as my new home.
</p>

<p>
    The pre-tenure period of my faculty career was distinguished by wonderful
    Ph.D. students, supportive colleagues across HCI and software engineering in
    both academia and industry, and exciting growth in the Information School
    faculty in data science, HCI, and several other fields. My own work
    continued to focus on developer tools, but began to incorporate more data
    science, investigating bug reporting from in a range of contexts, including
    open source, Agile teams, and private industry. While I did this work, I
    also developed a growing passion for research on the learning and teaching
    of computing, investigating new learning technologies and aspects of
    software engineering expertise. In 2013, I co-founded <External
        to="http://www.answerdash.com">AnswerDash</External
    > with Jake Wobbrock and Parmit Chilana. AnswerDash offered instant answers on
    websites using a selection-based search technology that was the centerpiece of
    Parmit's dissertation work.
</p>

<p>
    I earned tenure in 2015. I finished my last day AnswerDash in December of
    2015, resuming full-time faculty life on a short 6-month sabbatical. I used
    that time to begin a new focus on computing education research, inventing
    more effective, equitable, and scalable technologies and pedagogies for
    learning computer science. I also set out to help grow the field of
    computing education, help shape state and federal policy on computing
    education, and have impact by aggressively disseminating my lab's research.
</p>

<p>
    In Spring of 2017, our former Dean, Harry Bruce, asked me to chair our
    undergraduate major, Informatics. I accepted. While this was a big role, it
    only constituted 20% of my time and came with a healthy amount of teaching
    release to compensate. My job therefore expanded from research, teaching,
    service, and impact, to also include administrative duties. This brought a
    new dimension of impact to my work, allowing me to impact not only the
    iSchool's vision of undergraduate educations in information, but other
    iSchools as well.
</p>

<p>
    In Autumn 2019, I <External
        to="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/im-trans-call-me-amy-8a72a3951964"
        >came out as a trans woman</External
    >, finally accepting my gender identity and having the confidence to share
    it with the world. My academic communities were <External
        to="https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/what-coming-out-as-trans-should-look-like-395f31beeddb"
        >incredibly supportive</External
    >, which gave me to confidence to be out and proud. That same year, I was
    promoted to Professor, and pivoted my research to have a more critical
    stance, exploring literacies in both the powers and perils of computing and
    investigating CS teacher education. Shortly after I came out, the COVID-19
    pandemic arrived, and my lab and I went into survival mode, slowing down our
    work and doing our best to care for each other while in lockdown.
</p>

<p>
    In the summer of 2022, I started my first full-length sabbatical. It was
    very much needed after sabbatical and administrative stress, an empty nest,
    and far too much personal and professional isolation. What I wanted most
    from it was unconstrained time to find myself and create art. I spent most
    of it traveling solo and creating <External to="https://wordplay.dev"
        >Wordplay</External
    >. After a summer, an academic year, and another summer, I returned, mostly
    refreshed, and with a renewed sense of purpose and self, ready for another 6
    years of fragmented attention and public service. My Dean welcomed me back
    by asking me to serve as the iSchool's Associate Dean for Academics,
    starting Autumn of 2024. I agreed, and spent the year preparing to set aside
    most of my teaching for a few years to help the school manage its growth in
    students, faculty, staff, and academics programs, while (trying to) maintain
    my research activity.
</p>
